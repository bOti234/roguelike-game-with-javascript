# Introduction

This is a game I made to pass a web technology exam when I was around 17 years old.

As you'll see, this project was mostly made with the following languages:

-HTML, CSS

-JAVASCRIPT (mostly jQuery)

-SQL, PHP

Keep in mind, that when I made this game, I was unexperienced in programming and never learned it anywhere else except this course.

This means, that everything in the code will be extremely inefficient and ugly.
